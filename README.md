# Lexify - An Open-Source Vocabulary Learning Platform

Lexify is a desktop application designed to help users learn and manage vocabulary effectively. It combines the simplicity of a local desktop application with the functionality of cloud-based user synchronization.

> This is an course-design project for **2024 Fall** _Python Programming_ by student ID: `547a1ec97aff5d1cc4d5c510fcd126a8`, `344790860170dfd0e32af844eff9dac1`, `7f7948923fe752064204c07ee5e6524e`, `c7ca6a04c927df019ffb5e48374635f7` (MD5 Hash).

## Features (Planned)

- **Vocabulary Learning**: Memorize and review words with customizable study plans.

- **User Accounts**: Register, log in, and synchronize learning progress.

- **Predefined Libraries**: Includes common word libraries such as TOEFL, GRE, and more. (Future support for Japanese word libraries, such as JLPT N1 - N5 is planned.)

- **Custom Libraries**: Import external word lists and export them as printable PDFs or CSVs.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: PySide6 for the desktop application.
- **Backend**: Flask for user authentication and data synchronization.
- **Database**: SQLite for local and server-side data storage, with SQLAlchemy ORM for managing data models and queries.
- **Containerization**: Docker for backend deployment.

## Project Structure (Planned)
- `frontend/`: Desktop application source code.
- `backend/`: API and server-side logic.
- `database/`: Database schema and initialization scripts, managed via SQLAlchemy.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

## Getting Started
Development and deployment instructions will be added as the project progresses.
